# Vulkan-Compute Path Tracer

This project is a follow-up to an early project [CPU-Path-Tracer](https://github.com/PolarToCartesian/CPU-Path-Tracer). In order to optimize the rendering process and produce better images, I have chosen to make an implementation that leverages the [Vulkan API](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) as well as GPUs' massive multithreaded performance and computational power.
