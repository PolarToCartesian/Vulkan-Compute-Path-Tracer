# Vulkan-Compute Path Tracer

This project is a follow-up to an early project [CPU-Path-Tracer](https://github.com/PolarToCartesian/CPU-Path-Tracer). In order to optimize the rendering process and produce better images, I have chosen to make an implementation that leverages the [Vulkan API](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) as well as GPUs' massive multithreaded performance and computational power.

# Bug-Images

While fixing bugs, I often generate interesting images that arise from a problem in the shader code or outputting debug values as color. I have made some of these available [here](bug-images/README.md)
